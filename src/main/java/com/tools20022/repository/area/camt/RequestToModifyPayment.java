/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message is sent by a case creator/case assigner
 * to a case assignee.<br>
 * This message is used to request the modification of characteristics of an
 * original payment instruction.<br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message must be answered with a:<br>
 * - Resolution Of Investigation message with a positive final outcome when the
 * case assignee can perform the requested modification<br>
 * - Resolution Of Investigation message with a negative final outcome when the
 * case assignee may perform the requested modification but fails to do so (too
 * late, irrevocable instruction, one requested element cannot be modified.)<br>
 * - Reject Case Assignment message when the case assignee is unable or not
 * authorised to perform the requested modification<br>
 * - Notification Of Case Assignment message to indicate whether the case
 * assignee will take on the case himself or reassign the case to a subsequent
 * party in the payment processing chain.<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message covers one and only one original
 * instruction at a time. If several original payment instructions need to be
 * modified, then multiple Request To Modify Payment messages must be sent.<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message can be sent to request the modification
 * of one or several elements of the original payment instruction. If many
 * elements need to be modified, it is recommended to cancel the original
 * payment instruction and initiate a new one.<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment must be processed on an all or nothing basis.
 * If one of the elements to be modified cannot be altered, the assignment must
 * be rejected in full by means of a negative Resolution Of Investigation
 * message. (See section on Resolution Of Investigation for more details.)<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message must never be sent to request the
 * modification of the currency of the original payment instruction. If the
 * currency is wrong, use Request To Cancel Payment message to cancel it and
 * issue and a new payment instruction.<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message may be forwarded to subsequent case
 * assignee(s).<br>
 * When a Request To Modify Payment message is used to decrease the amount of
 * the original payment instruction, the modification will trigger a return of
 * funds from the case assignee to the case creator. The assignee may indicate,
 * within the Resolution Of Investigation message, the amount to be returned,
 * the date it is or will be returned and the channel through which the return
 * will be done.<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message must never be sent to request the
 * increase of the amount of the original payment instruction. To increase the
 * amount in a payment, the debtor can do one of the following:<br>
 * - Cancel the first payment using a Request To Cancel Payment message and make
 * a new payment with a higher and correct amount.<br>
 * - Simply send a second payment with the supplementary amount.<br>
 * Depending on the requested modification(s) and the processing stage of the
 * original payment instruction, the processing of a request to modify payment
 * case may end with one of the following:<br>
 * - an Additional Payment Information message sent to the creditor of the
 * original payment instruction<br>
 * - a Debit Authorisation Request message sent to the creditor of the original
 * payment instruction<br>
 * - a Request To Cancel Payment message sent to a subsequent case assignee<br>
 * The Request To Modify Payment message can be sent to correct characteristics
 * of an original payment instruction following receipt of an Unable To Apply
 * message. In this scenario, the case identification will remain the same.<br>
 * The RequestToModifyPayment message has the following main characteristics:<br>
 * The case creator assigns a unique case identification. This information will
 * be passed unchanged to all subsequent case assignee(s).<br>
 * Lowering the amount of an original payment instruction for which cover is
 * provided by a separate instruction will systematically mean the modification
 * of the whole transaction, including the cover. The case assignee performing
 * the amount modification must initiate the return of funds in excess to the
 * case creator.<br>
 * The modification of the agent's or agents' information on an original payment
 * instruction for which cover is provided by a separate instruction will
 * systematically mean the whole transaction is modified, i.e., the cover is
 * executed through the agent(s) mentioned in the Request To Modify Payment
 * message. The cover payment must not be modified separately.<br>
 * The modification of a payment instruction can be initiated by either the
 * debtor or any subsequent agent in the payment processing chain.<br>
 * The case creator provides the information to be modified in line with
 * agreements made with the case assignee. If the case assignee needs in turn to
 * assign the case to a subsequent case assignee, the requested modification(s)
 * must be in line with the agreement made with the next case assignee and a
 * Notification Of Case Assignment message must be sent to the case assigner.
 * Otherwise, the request to modify payment case must be rejected (by means of a
 * negative Resolution Of Investigation message).
